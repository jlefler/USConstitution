# USConstitution

This project was created as a way for me to begin to experiment with Kotlin code in Android. It simply parses the US constitution from an XML file (provided by Harry Surden [here.](https://github.com/hsurden/us-constitution) then displays it using Material Design. It is licensed under the MIT Open Source License.
